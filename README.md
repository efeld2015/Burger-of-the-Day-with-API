# Burger of the Day
This is for all the *Bob's Burgers* fans out there. With the click of a button, this site will randomly generate a particular Burger of the Day, what episode it was featured in, and what season. All burger names are puns ranging from ingenius to *groan*.

# How It's Made
Tech used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, a *Bob's Burgers* API

This started as a plain HTML and CSS project, where I had 6 buttons that only retrieved 6 pieces of hardcoded data (aka 6 burgers). I knew I would eventually need JavaScript skills to make what was in my head, but decided to create a sketch and build upon it later. Once I got comfortable with APIs, things really started cooking. I used event listeners for the button (which is actually an img tag wrapped in an anchor link tag), query selectors to display the data in the DOM, and functions. I had so much fun working on the front-end for this project--giving border to the 'chalkboard,' finding a handwritten-style font that was readable instead of distracting, using the bright and friendly color palette inspired by the show.

# Lessons Learned
I could have avoided a lot of frustration if I had read the API documentation more thoroughly the first time before writing any code. <em>Read twice (or thrice!), code once</em> is my new motto.
